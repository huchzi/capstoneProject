# Capstone Project
This is my Capstone Project for the Coursera Data Science specialization. The goal is to create a text prediction software.

This directory contains:
+ NGrams.R:               the code for extracting ngrams from the corpus
+ optimizeModel.Rmd:      the code for optimizing the model by calculating weights 
+ Directory corpus:       the corpus - the corpus is not synchronized via git
+ Directory PredictText:  the shiny app
+ Directory Presentation: a presentation explaining model and app
+ profanity.txt:          a list of profanities used for filtering before training the model
